# OOP Based Library with Database PYTHON
This is a library management system program written in Python using SQL database. The program allows users to either login or sign up if they do not have an account already. After logging in, users can check available books, borrow, return, and view books borrowed by them. The program also allows the admin to add new books to the library. The user login is done using password hashing using ```pbkdf2_sha256``` from ```passlib.hash``` module. The program uses the ```SQLAlchemy``` ORM to manage the SQL database. The program is written in Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.
